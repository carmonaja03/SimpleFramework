# SimpleFramework
I made this simple test framework that is using Java, Cucumber, Selenium, Maven that mimics large scale framework used by most comapanies. Test design is a combination of Page Object Model and Factory. It has all the component needed for a scalable test automation framework 
  1. .properties file 
  2. .yml and .ini file for testdata 
  3. utilities

Currently, It supports UI automation using selenium webdriver. API will be added in the future(still looking for opensource sites).


1. create a folder in your computer
2. clone this repository
3. download sources and documentation on the pom.xml
4. install java in your PC 
5. download cucumber for java, gherkin, and ini in intellij marketplace
6. start automating!
