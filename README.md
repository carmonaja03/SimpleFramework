# SimpleFramework
I made this simple test automation framework that supports Java, Cucumber, Selenium, Maven and can mimic large scale framework used by most tech companies. Test design is a combination of Page Object Model and Factory. It has most of the component needed for a scalable test automation framework 
  1.) .properties file 
  2.) .yml and .ini file for testdata 
  3.) utilities
  4.) reporting

Currently, It supports UI automation using selenium webdriver. API will be added in the future. Will also update this framework from time to time.


1.) create a folder in your laptop/PC
2.) clone this repository 
3.) download sources and documentation on the pom.xml
4.) install java in your laptop/PC 
5.) download cucumber for java, gherkin, and ini in intellij marketplace
6.) download selenium webdriver(version should match your chrome version) and place it on /drivers folder
6.) start automating! Try running the Google.feature file :)
