# SimpleFramework
I made this simple test framework that is using Java, Cucumber, Selenium, Maven that mimics large scale framework used by most tech comapanies. Test design is a combination of Page Object Model and Factory. It has all the component needed for a scalable test automation framework 
  1. .properties file 
  2. .yml and .ini file for testdata 
  3. utilities

Currently, It supports UI automation using selenium webdriver. API will be added in the future(still looking for opensource sites). Will also update this framework from time to time.


1. create a folder in your computer
2. clone this repository

4. install java in your laptop/PC 
5. download cucumber for java, gherkin, and ini in intellij marketplace
6. start automating!
