# SimpleFramework
I made this simple test framework that supports Java, Cucumber, Selenium, Maven and mimics large scale framework used by most tech comapanies. Test design is a combination of Page Object Model and Factory. It has all the component needed for a scalable test automation framework 
  1. .properties file 
  2. .yml and .ini file for testdata 
  3. has utilities
  4. has cluecumber reporting

Currently, It supports UI automation using selenium webdriver. API will be added in the future(still looking for opensource sites). Will also update this framework from time to time.


1. create a folder in your laptop/PC
2. clone this repository 
3. download sources and documentation on the pom.xml
4. install java in your laptop/PC 
5. download cucumber for java, gherkin, and ini in intellij marketplace
6. download selenium webdriver(version should match your chrome version) and place it on /drivers folder
6. start automating! 


Note:
The website used on this framework is opensource. you can use other website
